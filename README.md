# Python OOP Projects

This repository contains various Python projects implemented using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). Each project demonstrates different aspects of OOP, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Projects Included

* **Project 1: Drawing basic shapes of various size and color on a canvas.**
[CreateShapes-Folder](https://github.com/VarihtRaheja/python-OOP/tree/main/App1-createShapes)
    - A basic simulation of drawing basic geometric shapes like a square and rectangle with user defined sizes and color. Determining the area of the shape and checking if pointer is inside the boundary.

* **Project 2: Bill for Flatmates**
[Bill-Folder](https://github.com/VarihtRaheja/python-OOP/tree/main/app2-BillApp)
    - A system to dertermine the rent due for both flatmates, custom defined names and then creting a pdf of the reciept.


* **Project 3: Geometric Shapes Painter**
[MathPainter-Folder](https://github.com/VarihtRaheja/python-OOP/tree/main/app3-MathPainter)
    - A program that lets the user provide the start coordinates of geometrical shapes such as squares and rectangles, their dimensions, and their colors, and the program produces an image file canvas with all the geometrical shapes drawn in it.

* **Project 4: Webcam-Photo-Sharer**
[MathPainter-Folder](https://github.com/VarihtRaheja/python-OOP/tree/main/app4-Webcam-Photo-Sharer)
    - A program thatstarts the computer webcam, lets the user capture a photo and uploads the photo to the web and creates a sharable link.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, you need to have Python installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone "<repository_url>"
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of a specific project folder if applicable)*

3.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

`main.py` is used as the main file for running all projects. Most of the `objects` are used in main.py and have not been imported as seperate modules yet. This is done to make the running of the project easier since its all in one file. Some projects which may be web-based may have other `.py` modules.
